John is thirteen now .He began to study in a middle school two years ago .His family is in a small village and it’s nearly five kilometers from the school .He has to get up early in the morning .After a quick breakfast he has to run to school to get there on time .His father hopes to borrow some money to buy a bike for him ,but he know his mother is always ill and his father spends much money on her medicine .He doesn’t agree with him and keeps running there every day .Now he’s very strong and never late for class and his teachers often praise him .
Last week there was a sports meeting in their school .John ran faster than any other boy and won the boy’s 800 metres ,1,500metres and 3000 metres .He got there gold medals and the whole school knew him .His classmates and teachers offered congratulations to the boy and he was happy .He told his grandma about the good news as soon as he got home .
“I broke two school records today ,Granny ,”called out the boy .
To his surprise ,the old woman wasn’t happy .She thought for a while and said ,”I am sorry to hear that .We have no money to pay for them ,you know !”
